# Content Management System

Geoluminate directly integrates with DjangoCMS, allowing you to create and manage custom pages for your application. DjangoCMS lets you create community-focused content that doesn't rely on the core data model. You can create your own page layouts, add images, videos, and other media, and create menus and navigation for your application that makes sense for your community.



## What is a CMS?

A content management system (CMS) is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. The Geoluminate framework integrates seamlessly with [Django CMS](https://www.django-cms.org/en/) to provide a robust content management system that you can use to create community-focused content for your application that doesn't have to rely on the underlying research database. You can create your own page layouts, add images, videos, and other media, and create menus and navigation for your application that makes sense for your community. These pages can be created and managed through the Django CMS admin interface, and can be linked to from the rest of your application.

## How does it work?

At the moment, Geoluminate simply provides a few base templates for you to use with the Django CMS frontend editor. A number of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) components are also available for you to use in your custom pages. In the future, we hope to provide a number of pre-built page layouts that you can choose from to create a consistent feel across all of your pages. We also hope to introduce some of the more popular plugins from the Django CMS ecosystem to provide additional functionality to the core Geoluminate experience.
