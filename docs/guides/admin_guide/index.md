# Administrator Guide

```{attention}
This guide is designed to help site administrators of Geoluminate-powered portals to manage their database. It covers all aspects of site administration, from user management to content moderation and everything in between.
```

Geoluminate-powered applications inherit the full administrative capabilities provided by Django's built-in admin site. The admin site provides database administrators the ability to graphically interact with database tables, allowing them to easily view, add, modify, and delete entries. This streamlined interface simplifies database management tasks, even for users with limited technical expertise. From here, administrators can also manage user accounts, groups and roles, as well as configure global application settings and permissions.
