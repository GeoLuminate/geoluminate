## Frontend Frameworks and Libraries

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. It is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 135,000 stars and 60,000 forks.

Geoluminate uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) CSS framework to provide a consistent look and feel across all Geoluminate-powered applications. This provides a consistent user experience across all applications and reduces the amount of time required to develop new applications.

### jQuery

JQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. JQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web. It is also required by many of the other javascript libraries that Geoluminate relies on.

### Font Awesome

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less and was made by Dave Gandy for use with Twitter Bootstrap. The latest Font Awesome is used within Geoluminate to provide a consistent look and feel across all Geoluminate-powered applications. 


### Datatables

[Datatables](https://datatables.net) is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a highly flexible tool, based upon the foundations of progressive enhancement, and will add advanced interaction controls to any HTML table. Datatables is used within Geoluminate to provide highly-interactive tables that integrate directly with the backend framework through the API.
