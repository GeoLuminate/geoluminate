1. [Does Geoluminate support formal publication of datasets?](#publishin-support)

Geoluminate does not directly support formal publication of datasets. In other words, you cannot directly assign a data DOI to your datasets. However, utilities are provided that allow dataset creators to export metadata in a format that is compatible with the [DataCite Metadata Schema](https://schema.datacite.org/). This allows users to easily publish their datasets through external services that support the DataCite schema.
