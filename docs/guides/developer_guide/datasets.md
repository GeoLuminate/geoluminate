# Dataset Management

## Introduction

Community members can create and submit new datasets to the application, retaining full control over their content until it is formally published. Dataset creators can manage descriptions, key dates, and tags for enhanced discoverability. Metadata of public datasets are accessible to other community members, allowing them to view information related to the dataset. Once reviewed, datasets can be formally published, at which point their data becomes accessible for viewing and download within the application.

## Data Creation

Geoluminate-powered web application support the creation of new projects, datasets, samples and measurements directly within the application itself. Creation of data within the confines of the application means that users are implicitly guided through the process of collecting high quality data and metadata. In other words, the application makes it super easy to do the right thing, ensuring that new datasets are easy to publish and share while maintaing a high level of quality and integrity.


## Data Submission

While creation of new data within the framework is always encouraged, it is not required. Data can be submitted to the platform in a variety of ways, including via a web form, via a REST API, or via a bulk upload process. The platform is designed to be flexible and extensible, and so the submission process can be customized to meet the needs of the application.



## Data Publishing

Using the templating engine provided by Django, Geoluminate provides the abiltiy to export datasets in XML format as supported by DataCite publishing services. This allows users to publish datasets to to their preferred publishing services. The export functionality is designed to customizable, so the publishing process always fits the needs of the research community using the application. -->
