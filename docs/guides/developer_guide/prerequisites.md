# Required tools and assumed knowledge

## Assumed knowledge

If you're a researcher turned developer (like me!), it's likely that you're already familiar with Python to some degree. This is great because Geoluminate is built on top of the Django web framework, which is written in Python. However, if you're new to Python, you may want to brush up on some of the basics before you begin.

If you are new to the world of web development, you may want to familiarize yourself with some of the basic concepts of web development before you begin. While Geoluminate is designed to be easy to use, it will serve you well in the long run to have a basic understanding of the mechanisms behind the framework.

Finally, this package enables you to deploy easily to the cloud using Docker. If you are new to Docker, you may want to familiarize yourself with some of the basic concepts before you begin.

Here's what you should be familiar with before you begin:

**Python**
- Object-oriented programming
- Virtual environments
- Package management
- Testing and debugging
  
**Web development**
- Model, view, controller (MVC) architecture
- What languages are used for what purposes

**Django**
- Consider doing the Django tutorial if you're not already familiar with Django

**Docker**
- Basic understanding of containers

**Git**
- You will want to have familiarity with Git and GitHub to effectivel manage your project

## Tools and Technologies

**Python 3.6+** (with the following packages installed globally)
- poetry
- cookiecutter
- invoke (optional)

You can install these packages globally using pip:

```bash
pip install poetry cookiecutter invoke
```

**Git**
If you don't have it on your system already, Google how to install Git for you OS. You will also probably need a GitHub account to manage your repo and collaborate with others.

**Docker**
Follow the instructions on the official Docker website to install Docker on your system.

## Recommended tools:

**Visual Studio Code**
This is a great IDE for Python and web development. It has a lot of great features and extensions that will make your life easier. Better yet, the template project comes with a VS code workspace file that will automatically configure your workspace with the recommended extensions and settings.
