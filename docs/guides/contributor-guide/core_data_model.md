## Introduction

The core data model of Geoluminate is designed to capture and describe any information relevant to a specific research domain. It is a set of structured data models that are used to capture metadata related to research projects, datasets, contributors, samples, measurements, and observations. The core data model is designed to be both machine- and human-readable, allowing researchers to formally publish their datasets and properly attribute all individuals and organizations involved in the data collection and processing lifecycle.
