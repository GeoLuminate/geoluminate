## Anonymous browsing

Geoluminate-powered web portals support anonymous browsing and consumption of data. This means that you can browse, search, explore, view and download all publicly available content without having to sign up for an account. In order to maintain a safe and productive environment for community members, some functionality is restricted to authenticated users only.

While browsing as an anonymous user, you will find [an icon](#user_toolbar_toggle) in the top right corner of the page that allows you to log in or sign up for an account. Clicking on this icon will open a sidebar that allows you to enter your email address and password. Once you have entered your email address and password, click on the `Sign Up` button to create your account.

## Joining a community

Geoluminate-powered portals are focused on community-building and engagement. As such, we encourage you to sign up for an account with any community if you think you can make a meaningful contribution! If account registration is open, you will find a `Register` tab on the anonymous user toolbar that will allow you to sign up for an new account. There are generally two ways to register for an account. Either you can use a third-party authentication service OR you can sign up using some basic details and a valid email address.

```{attention}

Some research communities may be invite only or restrict participation in some way (e.g. only allow emails with a specific domain). In such cases, it may not be so easy to join the community of your choosing. However, you can always reach out direct to the community administrator to see what they say.

### Third-party authentication

Third-party authentication services allow you to sign up for an account using an existing account with a third-party service. This is the easiest way to sign up for an account as it does not require you to remember yet another password. If you choose to sign up using a third-party authentication service, you will be redirected to the third-party service's website where you will be asked to grant permission for the Geoluminate-powered portal to access your account information. Once you have granted permission, you will be redirected back to the Geoluminate-powered portal and your account will be created. You will then be able to log in to the portal using the third-party authentication service.
