# Datasets

## What is a dataset?

In simple terms, a project is a collection of datasets that share some common metadata (e.g. a single funding source). In Geoluminate-powered applications, projects are a way to organize datasets, share thoughts and ideas, collaborate with others and establish new networks and connections.
If you have an exciting idea but lack the expertise, equipment or funding to get it off the ground, you can lay out your ideas in a new project and ask the community for support. If you are a researcher looking for a new project to work on, you can browse through the projects that have been created by others and offer your expertise. If you are a funder looking to support a new project, you can browse through the projects that have been created by others and offer your funding.

If you don't want to share your project with the world just yet, you can make it private and invite only those you trust to collaborate with you.
