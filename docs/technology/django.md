# Django

## What is Django?

Django is a modern, high-level web framework written in Python. It provides a wide range of features and tools out of the box to help developers build web applications quickly and efficiently, without having to reinvent the wheel. Django is actively maintained and has a large and vibrant community of developers who contribute to its growth and success. A large number of community-driven third-party packages are available to extend Django's functionality and add new features, creating an ecosystem of near-endless possibilities.

For the unfamiliar, endless possibilities quickly becomes overwhelming.

Geoluminate is built on top of Django and aims to reduce the complexity in building a modern research data platfrom by providing sensible default configurations and best practices out of the box. This "batteries-included" approach allows researchers to focus on building robust measurement schema that reflect the specific needs of their research community — everything else should just work.

Geoluminate is designed to help researchers focus on building a robust measurement schema that reflects the specific needs of their research community and building their platform into a valuable resource for their community.



Geoluminate is built on top of Django and therefore inherits all of its features and capabilities. This includes a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for interacting with databases, a robust authentication system for managing user accounts and permissions, a flexible templating engine for rendering HTML templates, and a built-in admin interface for managing data models. 

Geoluminate further extends Django by providing tools and features specifically tailored towards the creation, maintenance and deployment of online research data portals. These include a robust core data model, a contributor framework for proper credit attribution and a site design that facilitates discovery and promotes community-engagement and collaboration. By taking care of this foundational work, Geoluminate allows researchers-turned-developers to focus on two things: building a robust measurement schema that reflects the specific needs of their research community and building their platform into a valuable resource for their community.

Geoluminate builds upon the Django philosophy by providing a set of tools and features specifically tailored for researchers looking wish to build web portals for their research communities. Geoluminate includes a range of geospatial capabilities, such as integration with the PostGIS extension, that allow researchers to efficiently store, retrieve, and analyze spatial data.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

Given that many researchers are already familiar with Python, Django is the perfect framework to consider for building web portals. Django is a high-level web framework that is written in Python and offers a range of features and tools specifically designed to streamline web development.

Here are some reasons why Django (and therefore Geoluminate) is a great choice for researchers that wish to build a web portal:

1. **Pythonic and Familiar**: Researchers who are already familiar with Python will find Django's syntax and development patterns intuitive and easy to grasp. Django follows Python's philosophy of readability and emphasizes clean, maintainable code.

2. **Rapid Development**: Django's batteries-included approach provides a robust set of built-in functionalities, such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database management, user authentication, form handling, and more. This accelerates development and allows researchers to focus on their specific portal requirements.

3. **Secure and Scalable**: Django incorporates security features by default, including protection against common web vulnerabilities. It also supports scalability through efficient query optimization, caching mechanisms, and integration with various deployment options.

4. **Rich Ecosystem and Community**: Django has a thriving community and a rich ecosystem of third-party packages, extensions, and libraries. Researchers can leverage these resources to add specific functionality, integrate with scientific libraries, or extend the capabilities of their web portal.

5. **Geospatial Capabilities**: If your research involves geospatial data or analysis, Django integrates seamlessly with the PostGIS extension, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of spatial data.

6. **Documentation and Support**: Django offers comprehensive and well-maintained documentation, making it easier for researchers to learn and troubleshoot. Additionally, the Django community provides active support through forums, mailing lists, and online resources.

### Whats included?

Django includes a range of features and tools that are specifically designed to streamline web development. Here are some of the key features:

- **Object-Relational Mapping**: Django provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database management. This allows you to define your data models in Python and interact with your database using Python objects, rather than writing SQL queries directly. Django supports a range of database backends, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.
- **User Authentication**: Django provides a robust authentication system that allows you to manage user accounts, permissions, and groups. This includes built-in views and forms for user registration, login, logout, and password management.
- **Form Handling**: Django provides a form handling library that allows you to define forms in Python and render them in your templates. This includes built-in form validation and error handling.
- **Template Engine**: Django provides a template engine that allows you to define templates in HTML and render them in your views. This includes built-in template tags and filters for common tasks, such as displaying data from your database.
- **Admin Interface**: Django provides a built-in admin interface that allows you to manage your data models and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your database. This includes built-in views and forms for managing your data models.
- **Security Features**: Django incorporates security features by default, including protection against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.
