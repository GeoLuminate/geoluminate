# Celery

[Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) is a distributed task queue library for Python that is commonly used in web applications for handling asynchronous and background tasks. Some typical tasks that might be offloaded to Celery include:

1. **Sending Emails**: Asynchronous email sending is a common task in web applications. Celery can be used to queue email sending tasks, allowing the web application to respond quickly to user requests without waiting for the emails to be sent.

2. **Processing Uploaded Files**: When users upload files, especially large ones, it's often preferable to process them asynchronously to avoid tying up server resources. Celery can handle tasks such as file compression, image resizing, or data parsing in the background.

3. **Generating Reports**: Generating reports or performing data analysis tasks can be time-consuming, especially for complex or large datasets. Celery can be used to run these tasks asynchronously, freeing up server resources for handling user requests.

4. **Scheduled Tasks**: Celery supports scheduling tasks to run at specific times or intervals. This can be useful for performing periodic maintenance tasks, such as database cleanup or data aggregation.

5. **Handling Webhooks**: Webhooks are often used for integrating with third-party services or receiving real-time updates. Celery can handle webhook payloads asynchronously, processing them in the background without blocking the main application thread.

6. **Cache Management**: Celery can be used to asynchronously refresh or invalidate cached data, ensuring that the cache stays up-to-date without impacting the responsiveness of the web application.

7. **Database Operations**: Long-running database operations, such as data migration or data import/export tasks, can be offloaded to Celery to avoid blocking the main application.

8. **Image Processing**: Tasks like image manipulation, such as cropping, rotating, or applying filters, can be handled asynchronously by Celery, allowing the web application to respond quickly to user requests.

9. **Integration with External APIs**: Integrating with external APIs often involves making network requests, which can be slow and unreliable. Celery can handle these requests asynchronously, ensuring that the main application remains responsive.

10. **Machine Learning Model Inference**: If your web application uses machine learning models for tasks like recommendations or predictions, Celery can handle the inference tasks asynchronously, improving the scalability and responsiveness of the application.

Overall, Celery is a versatile tool for handling a wide range of asynchronous tasks in web applications, helping to improve performance, scalability, and user experience.
