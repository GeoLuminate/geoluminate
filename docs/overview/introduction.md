# Introduction

Consistency in design among research data portals is crucial for adhering to the FAIR data principles and enhancing the discoverability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of scientific data. Geoluminate aims to implement a simplified framework for constructing modern and intuitive research portals with a consistent look and feel that makes creating and reusing scientific data a breeze. A simplified framework provides several benefits over current approaches to research portal development.

Firstly, a simplified framework reduces development time and costs by providing pre-defined design patterns, templates, and reusable components. This enables research institutions and organizations to create new data portals more efficiently, without the need to reinvent the wheel with each implementation. By streamlining the development process, valuable resources can be allocated to improving data quality, metadata standards, and other critical aspects of research data management.

Secondly, a simplified framework ensures a cohesive user experience across different research portals. Researchers and data users can navigate and interact with various portals with a sense of familiarity, regardless of their specific domain or focus. This consistency in design reduces the learning curve, enhances usability, and boosts user confidence in exploring and utilizing diverse datasets. Researchers can spend less time adapting to different interfaces and more time on actual data analysis and interpretation.

Furthermore, a simplified framework facilitates collaboration and knowledge exchange by enabling seamless integration and data sharing among research portals. By adhering to common data formats, metadata standards, and APIs, researchers can effortlessly combine and compare datasets from different portals. This integration enhances cross-disciplinary collaboration, supports interdisciplinary research, and encourages the discovery of new insights and discoveries.

Additionally, a simplified framework promotes scalability and extensibility in research data portals. As the volume and complexity of scientific data continue to grow, having a consistent foundation for portal construction allows for easier maintenance, updates, and future enhancements. It ensures that new features and functionalities can be seamlessly integrated into existing portals or extended to accommodate evolving research needs, without compromising the overall user experience.

Geoluminate is a powerful framework with a simple API that aims to streamline the process of creating and maintaining a modern research data portal. It is built around the popular [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com) and takes care of many design decisions that can be overwhelming for non-developers. Unlike most web frameworks, Geoluminate is *inflexible* by design so that all Geoluminate-powered research portals are presented in a standardized, interoperable format that just works.

## Our Mission

To establish, maintain and support a framework capable of building interconnected networks of de-centralized, self-hosted and community-driven research data portals that work anywhere.

## Our Vision

Geoluminate promotes a vision of decentralized, interconnected, self-hosted and community-driven research data portals that work anywhere. The responsibility of defining a schema to describe the data that matters most to your research community should belong to domain experts, not web database technicians. 

## Our Goals

### To foster collaboration and community building

At the heart of Geoluminate lies a profound commitment to community building and fostering collaboration among researchers. Our web-framework is not just a technical solution; it's a catalyst for empowering research communities to thrive together. Geoluminate provides the perfect platform to unite researchers, innovators, and experts from various fields, facilitating seamless collaboration and knowledge exchange.

### To adhere to the principles of the FAIR data directive

Geoluminate is driven by a core mission to enhance findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability among research portals. We understand the importance of promoting open and seamless data sharing in research communities.

### Credit where credit is due

Geoluminate provides intuitive tools and features that guide researchers in documenting their projects and datasets with the metadata required to formally publish their work. This includes capturing information such as authorship, affiliations, methodology, funding sources, and any other relevant details that contribute to the transparency and traceability of the research.






## Open and FAIR


## Core Philosophies

- **Simplicity** 

    Geoluminate is designed to be simple and easy to use. It provides a minimalistic API that allows researchers to focus on their specific portal requirements, rather than worrying about the underlying implementation details.

- **Consistency**
  
    Geoluminate follows the "convention over configuration" principle and emphasizes consistency over flexibility. This allows researchers to build their portal using a set of well-defined patterns and best practices resulting in a predictable web portal experience.

- **Batteries Included**
  
    Geoluminate provides a robust set of built-in functionalities such as user authentication, project management, dataset creation and submission, review processes and more.

- **Community Driven**

    Geoluminate-powered portals are community-powered portals! Geoluminate is designed to encourage collaboration, data sharing and network building among individual researchers within the community. Using a Geoluminate-powered portal should be like meeting your colleagues by the water cooler - you can share your latest research, ask for help, or just have a chat.
