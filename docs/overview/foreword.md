Years ago, during my PhD studies, I took on the task of transforming a large spreadsheet into an interactive online portal for fellow researchers. What seemed like a straightforward project ended up spanning my entire PhD journey, partly because I genuinely enjoyed the process, and partly because web applications are never truly complete (consider yourself warned!).

As I continued to learn, I encountered many individuals working on similar projects but found it difficult to share experiences due to vastly different approaches to achieving the same goals. It sure would have been nice if everybody was using the same set of tools to accomplish the same task!

While I succeeded in my own implementation, I realized that there were areas where I could have done better, particularly in terms of code reusability. After graduation, I re-examined my codebase and extracted the core components necessary for building a data-driven web portal. I then set about restructuring those components for greater reusability and organized them in a repository for easy access in future projects.

After completing this, I came to the realization that the only remaining elements in my original work were the model definitions specific to my project. It then dawned on me that I could transform my collection of reusable components into a streamlined framework that others could utilize to construct their own data portals. And so, Geoluminate came into existence.

Ultimately, Geoluminate aims to streamline the process of creating community-driven scientific web portals by providing a solid foundation built on years of experience, a collection of reusable tools and components, and thorough documentation. 

All the best with your future projects!
