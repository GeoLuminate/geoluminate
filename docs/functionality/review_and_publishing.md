## What is a submission?
A submission is the act of uploading a file to the server and successfully having the contents parsed into the database.

## What is a review?
Datasets must be peer-reviewed by a “Community Reviewer” before it is possible to publish. A review consists of a check of the data and assessment of quality. This is followed by dialogue back and forth between reviewer and submitter. Once accepted by the reviewer, the dataset becomes visible in the application and the submitter is granted access to publish (and perhaps download a quality assurance certificate?).
