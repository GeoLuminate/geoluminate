# Introduction

The only thing we want you to concentrate on is determining the fields and validation necessary for your community to collect high-quality research data. Everything else should just work!

## Is Geoluminate what you're looking for?

**For researchers**

Yes, you are the target audience of this package. Geoluminate was created from the reusable parts of a project that is most likely very similar to the project that brought you to this page. If you want to learn more about what Geoluminate can offer you, head to the [overview section](overview). Otherwise, if you prefer to learn by doing, have a go at following along with the [tutorial](tutorial).

**For developers**

Yes, Geoluminate is for you. However, there are things you need to be aware of before jumping in. Geoluminate is not a Django package that you plugin in to an existing project, *it is* the project and you can extend it to suit your needs. In other words, this package is more like a cookiecutter template.



## Philosopy

- The role of Geoluminate is to abstract away development decisions so that non-developers don't get caught up in common Django pitfalls.
