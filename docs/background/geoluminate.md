# Geoluminate

## What is Geoluminate?

Geoluminate is a Python-based micro web framework that allows research communities to easily and declaratively define data models that capture and describe any information relevant to their specific research domain. It is designed to help researchers adhere to metadata schemas that make it easy to formally publish their datasets and properly attribute all individuals and organisations involved in their data collection and processing lifecycle. Geoluminate leverages the established tools and features of the Django Web Framework in order to build lasting research portals that will grow with your community's expectation into the future.


You can host your own community portal online, publish a container that others can install and run on their own servers or distribute a lite version that runs completely offline on a field laptop. All of this is possible with Geoluminate!

## What problems does Geoluminate solve?

### Data Quality and Metadata Standards

Geoluminate-powered portals are designed to help researchers adhere to metadata schemas that make it easy to formally publish their datasets and properly attribute all individuals and organisations involved in their data collection and processing lifecycle.

, making it easier for them to publish their datasets while ensuring that the necessary information for attribution is captured accurately. By following these established schemas, we streamline the process of documenting and sharing datasets, facilitating proper credit attribution throughout the research community.


### Data Ownership

Ownership and control of research data is perhaps one of the biggest barriers to open science and FAIR data.

Ownership of data is not just an issue for individuals looking to maintain control over their scientific data. Data ownership and proper accreditation are also incredibly important at both the institutional and national level.




### Data Interoperability

In order to decentralize the research data landscape, it is extremely important to facilitate data interoperability across numerous systems and platforms. This is where Geoluminate comes in. By providing a standardized schema for research data, Geoluminate ensures that data can be easily shared and integrated across different research communities and platforms.

## What other benefits does Geoluminate offer?

### Community building

Geoluminate allows you to focus on cultivating a strong sense of belonging within your research community. Through interactive features and engaging functionalities, you can nurture meaningful connections and foster a spirit of collaboration that transcends geographical boundaries.

### Collaboration


### Publication

Geoluminate provides a platform for researchers to publish their datasets, confident that their contributions will be appropriately acknowledged within the scholarly community.
