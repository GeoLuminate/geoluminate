# Web Frameworks

If you are looking to build an online web portal for your research community, you will need to choose a web framework. There are many different web frameworks available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

## What is Geoluminate?

Geoluminate is a boilerplate web framework built on top of the Django Web Framework. The intent is to provide default settings, templates and common functionalities in order to simplify the development process and provide a consistent look and feel across all Geoluminate applications. Geoluminate is specifically targetted towards researchers with minimal experience in web-development that wish to build an online research portal as simply and quickly as possible.

## What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

Given that many researchers are already familiar with Python, Django is the perfect framework to consider for building web portals. Django is a high-level web framework that is written in Python and offers a range of features and tools specifically designed to streamline web development.

Here are some reasons why Django (and therefore Geoluminate) is a great choice for researchers that wish to build a web portal:

1. **Pythonic and Familiar**: Researchers who are already familiar with Python will find Django's syntax and development patterns intuitive and easy to grasp. Django follows Python's philosophy of readability and emphasizes clean, maintainable code.

2. **Rapid Development**: Django's batteries-included approach provides a robust set of built-in functionalities, such as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database management, user authentication, form handling, and more. This accelerates development and allows researchers to focus on their specific portal requirements.

3. **Secure and Scalable**: Django incorporates security features by default, including protection against common web vulnerabilities. It also supports scalability through efficient query optimization, caching mechanisms, and integration with various deployment options.

4. **Rich Ecosystem and Community**: Django has a thriving community and a rich ecosystem of third-party packages, extensions, and libraries. Researchers can leverage these resources to add specific functionality, integrate with scientific libraries, or extend the capabilities of their web portal.

5. **Geospatial Capabilities**: If your research involves geospatial data or analysis, Django integrates seamlessly with the PostGIS extension, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of spatial data.

6. **Documentation and Support**: Django offers comprehensive and well-maintained documentation, making it easier for researchers to learn and troubleshoot. Additionally, the Django community provides active support through forums, mailing lists, and online resources.

### Whats included?

Django includes a range of features and tools that are specifically designed to streamline web development. Here are some of the key features:

- **Object-Relational Mapping**: Django provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database management. This allows you to define your data models in Python and interact with your database using Python objects, rather than writing SQL queries directly. Django supports a range of database backends, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.
- **User Authentication**: Django provides a robust authentication system that allows you to manage user accounts, permissions, and groups. This includes built-in views and forms for user registration, login, logout, and password management.
- **Form Handling**: Django provides a form handling library that allows you to define forms in Python and render them in your templates. This includes built-in form validation and error handling.
- **Template Engine**: Django provides a template engine that allows you to define templates in HTML and render them in your views. This includes built-in template tags and filters for common tasks, such as displaying data from your database.
- **Admin Interface**: Django provides a built-in admin interface that allows you to manage your data models and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your database. This includes built-in views and forms for managing your data models.
- **Security Features**: Django incorporates security features by default, including protection against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.
- **Scalability**: Django supports scalability through efficient query optimization, caching mechanisms, and integration with various deployment options.
- **Geospatial Capabilities**: Django integrates seamlessly with the PostGIS extension, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of spatial data.
- **Rich Ecosystem and Community**: Django has a thriving community and a rich ecosystem of third-party packages, extensions, and libraries. This allows you to add specific functionality, integrate with scientific libraries, or extend the capabilities of your web portal.

### Drawbacks

- **Learning Curve**: Django has a steep learning curve, especially for researchers who are new to web development. It requires a solid understanding of Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as familiarity with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
- **Deployment**: Django does not provide a built-in deployment solution. This can make it challenging for researchers to deploy their web portal to a production environment.
