# Introduction

Geoluminate is a web-framework that allows you to easily build a data portal for your research community with a final product that is totally consistent and interoperable with other Geoluminate-powered portals. You can define your own custom schema for your database or use an existing schema defined by another research community. You can host your own community portal online, publish a container that others can install and run on their own servers or distribute a lite version that runs completely offline on a field laptop. All of this is possible with Geoluminate!


Use cases


Imagine that a community of international researchers has come together to collectively set rules and guidelines for the collection and storage of data specific to their research domain. They identify the fields and validation necessary to collect high-quality research data, and they eventually agree on a standardized schema to describe their data. But what happens next?

In many cases, communities will then create a spreadsheet to collect and store their data. They will then distribute this spreadsheet as a template and ask future researchers to use it. This seems like a logical first step but will ultimately lead to failure. Why?

1. Spreadsheets are designed primarily to display data. They provide very little control over what data is entered and how it is entered. This leads to data that is inconsistent, incomplete, and often incorrect.
2. Spreadsheets are personal. No matter how good the template, individuals using it will always rearrange columns, add new columns, and remove columns that they don't need. This leads to data that is inconsistent, incomplete, and often incorrect. 
3. 

The community in question may also decide that a centralized database is necessary to store their data for increased discovery, dissemination and reuse of collected data.





## Who should use Geoluminate?

For any given community of international researchers, Geoluminate provides a simple method to explicitly define and version control their schema. From this, the schema can be used to create an online database-driven application that acts as a centralized repository for all researchers to 


 in order to build an online web portal that adheres to that schema. On the other hand, it provides web developers with a collection of reusable tools and components that can be used to streamline the process of building a web portal for a research community.


Traditionally, the next step would be to hire a web developer to build a web portal that adheres to the agreed-upon schema. This is where Geoluminate comes in. Geoluminate is a framework that allows you to build a web portal that adheres to the agreed-upon schema, without having to hire a web developer.


Geoluminate is a sophisticated web-framework designed to cater to the needs of researchers and innovators. It offers a comprehensive solution for creating and hosting community-driven web portals, taking into account the specific challenges faced by scientific research communities.

As a researcher, your focus should be on advancing knowledge and driving collaboration, rather than getting caught up in the complexities of web development. Geoluminate aims to alleviate those burdens by providing "best practice" design decisions out of the box that handle the technical intricacies of building modern, high-performance web applications. In other words, Geoluminate is batteries included!

With Geoluminate, you have the freedom to design and customize your database schema effortlessly. Showcase your research, engage your community, and expand your impact with ease. Our framework is built to streamline the process, allowing you to channel your energy into what truly matters: groundbreaking research.

Join the ranks of researchers who have embraced Geoluminate and transformed their online presence. Discover a world where your ideas can shine brightly and reach a global audience. Geoluminate empowers you to unlock the full potential of your research community, fostering knowledge exchange and collaboration.

Geoluminate is a high-level web-framework that empowers research communities to design, create and host their own community-driven web portals without concern for the intricacies, pitfalls and gotchas of building modern and highly-performant web-applications.  

With Geoluminate, you can create community-driven web portals that become vibrant hubs for like-minded individuals to come together, share their insights, and spark new ideas. Our user-friendly interface ensures that even those without extensive technical backgrounds can actively contribute to the platform.

The only thing we want you to concentrate on is determining the fields and validation necessary for your community to collect high-quality research data. Everything else should just work!



## How it works

Imagine that a community of international researchers has come together to collectively set rules and guidelines for the collection and storage of data specific to their research domain. They identify the fields and validation necessary to collect high-quality research data, and they agree on (and maybe even publish) a standardized schema to describe their data. But what happens next?

In many cases, communities will then create a spreadsheet to collect and store their data. They will then distribute this spreadsheet as a template and ask future researchers to use it. This seems like a logical first step but will ultimately lead to failure. Why?

1. Spreadsheets are designed primarily to display data. They provide very little control over what data is entered and how it is entered. This leads to data that is inconsistent, incomplete, and often incorrect.
2. Spreadsheets are personal. Whether provided with a template or not, in most cases, individual researchers will rearrange columns, add new columns, and remove columns that they don't need. This leads to data that is inconsistent, incomplete, and often incorrect.
