# FAQ's

## I prefer to use \<insert database backend> because it does \<x>. Is there support for that?

No, there is no support for alternative database backends. One of Geoluminate's core philosophies is to take as many decisions out of the users hands as possible to reduce complexity for non-developers being thrust into the world of web development.

Many core features of GEoluminate rely on PostgreSQL specific utilities such as the PostGIS extension and several Postgres only database fields. There is no real good reason to support multiple database backends.
