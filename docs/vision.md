# Vision

While there is general agreement that research data should be made open and accessible in accordance with the FAIR data principles, there are fundamental barriers to the realization of this vision. One such barrier centres around the issue of control. In a centralized system, a single entity or group of entities controls the research data repository and makes decisions about how and where data are stored, accessed, and shared. This can lead to issues around ownership, privacy, and security, as well as concerns about censorship and data manipulation.

In many global jurisdictions, the *control* of data is a contentious issue. Data is often seen as a valuable asset, and there are many stakeholders who have an interest in controlling it. Governments, corporations, and other entities often seek to control data for a variety of reasons, including economic, political, and social gain. This means that a centralized system based in Country A may not be a viable storage solution for data generated in Country B, as Country B may have, for example, regulations that require the strict use of national infrastructure.

To address such issues,

## Decentralisation

### What does it mean?

Decentralisation is a concept whereby control and decision-making process are distributed across a network of nodes, rather than a single central authority. In a decentralised system, data can be stored and shared across multiple nodes, each of which has its own copy of the data (or relevant subset). This means that no single entity has control over the entire network, and decisions about how and which data are stored, accessed, and distributed can be made by nodes on an individual basis.

### How would it work?

![Decentralization example - global network](/_static/decentralization_example.svg)


Geoluminate-powered portals come equipped with a configuration file that defines all services necessary to deploy a single instance of the portal in an isolated environment. If the underlying codebase is publicly available, anybody (individual researchers, research institutions, government organisations, commercial entities, etc.), can deploy their own instance to a private or public server. 

Instances of a portal can be configured to act as nodes in a decentralised network by registering the node with any other compatible node. This establishes a network of interconnected repositories that store and share research data in a predictable and consistent manner. Each repository can easily be customised to meet the specific needs of its community, for example, to only store datasets that contain data collected within the borders of Country B. Conversely, an international research consortium may choose to create a single, centralised repository that stores a copy of data from all nodes in the network. 

Communication between nodes in a network will be facilitated by the standardised API that is automatically generated and published by all Geoluminate-powered portals. The actual protocols used for communication are yet to be determined and you are encouraged to join our [https://github.com/Geoluminate/geoluminate/discussions](discussions) on Github to help shape the future of the project.

<!-- From ChatGPT regarding the above content:

Your vision for a decentralized network of research data portals addresses several critical issues in the current landscape of research data management, such as control, ownership, privacy, and accessibility. Here are some feedback and suggestions for improvement:

Clarity on the Decentralized Model: You've provided a good overview of the benefits of decentralization, but it would be helpful to provide more specifics on how the decentralized model works in practice. For example, you could elaborate on the consensus mechanisms or protocols used for data replication, synchronization, and validation among nodes in the network.

Incentivization and Governance: In decentralized systems, it's crucial to consider mechanisms for incentivizing participation and ensuring governance. How will nodes be incentivized to join the network? Who governs the network and makes decisions about its operation and evolution? Addressing these questions will help build trust and engagement among potential participants.

Interoperability and Standards: You've mentioned the standardized API generated by Geoluminate-powered portals, which is a good start. However, interoperability goes beyond API standards. Consider incorporating widely accepted data exchange standards (e.g., JSON-LD, RDF) to ensure compatibility with other systems and platforms outside the network.

Data Sovereignty and Compliance: You've rightly pointed out the importance of respecting national regulations and data sovereignty requirements. It would be beneficial to provide more details on how the decentralized network ensures compliance with diverse legal and regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions.

Scalability and Performance: As the network grows, scalability and performance become critical factors. How does the architecture handle an increasing number of nodes and data volumes while maintaining efficiency and responsiveness? Consider exploring strategies such as sharding, caching, and load balancing to optimize performance.

Security and Resilience: Decentralized systems often face security challenges, such as data breaches, DDoS attacks, and malicious nodes. Describe the security measures implemented in the network, such as encryption, access controls, and anomaly detection, to mitigate these risks and ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

Community Engagement and Collaboration: Encourage active participation and collaboration within the research community to foster adoption and contribute to the network's growth and sustainability. Provide mechanisms for feedback, discussion forums, and collaborative initiatives to empower stakeholders to shape the network according to their needs and priorities.

Documentation and Support: Clear documentation and user support are essential for onboarding new participants and ensuring smooth operation of the network. Provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and help resources to assist users in setting up, configuring, and troubleshooting their instances of the portal. -->
