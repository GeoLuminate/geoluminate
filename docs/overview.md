# Overview

Geoluminate makes some significant design decisions for you and this section is provided to try and explain what those decisions are and why we made them. We try to make decisions based on our understanding of current best practices in the Django community, the availability of open source tools and any advice we can find online from people that are really experienced in this sort of thing. If, while reading through this section you find a decision that you don't quite agree with or think something could be done better, why not {ref}`learn how to contribute to Geoluminate <CONTRIBUTING:Contributing>`?
