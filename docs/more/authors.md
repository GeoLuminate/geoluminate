Development of this research data repository and the schema it contains is supported by an international community of scientific researchers led by the [International Heat Flow Commission](http://ihfc-iugg.org). Development was funded through the [World Heat Flow Database Project](http://heatflow.world).


<!-- Geoluminate as an open-source project is currently in active development thanks to the GeoForschungsZentrum_, Potsdam, DE. Geoluminate was in it's infancy as both a package and a concept when it was adopted by the `World Heat Flow Database Project`_ as the framework for a new web application designed to support and serve the updated `Global Heat Flow Database`_ of the IHFC_. Because of this ongoing support, Geoluminate will receive full time attention until at least June
