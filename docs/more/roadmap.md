# Roadmap

This document outlines the objectives and goals for the development of the Geoluminate framework. It is intended to provide a high-level overview of the project's direction and priorities, and is subject to change as the project evolves. The roadmap is divided into several milestones, each representing a set of tasks and deliverables.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup

- âœ… Set up the project structure and directory layout.
- âœ… Initialize version control with Git and create a repository.
- âœ… Choose a package management tool (e.g., Poetry, pipenv) and set up the project dependencies.

## Milestone 2: Build Foundations

- âœ… Configure a continuous integration (CI) system for automated testing and deployment.
- âœ… Create and publish a Docker image for building the core application
- âœ… Decide on tech stack to support the application
- âœ… Create a compose file that orchestrates the build process in local environments
- ðŸ”² Create a compose file that orchestrates the build process in production environments
- ðŸ”² Create a compose file that orchestrates the build process lite environments (for running offline on laptops)

## Milestone 3: Core Functionality

- âœ… Define the core functionality and features of the project.
- âœ… Implement the foundational classes and modules.
- ðŸ”² Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the core functionality.
- ðŸ”² Conduct thorough testing and debugging to identify and fix any issues.

## Milestone 4: User Interface

- ðŸ”² Create browsable projects, datasets and samples to showcase user contributions
- ðŸ”² Design and implement the mechanics of a RESTful API.
- ðŸ”² Design and develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the project.
- ðŸ”² Perform usability testing to gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

## Milestone 5: Documentation and Examples
