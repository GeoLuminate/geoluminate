# Contribution Framework

FairDM features a generic contribution framework that ensures both personal and organisational users are properly credited for their contributions at all levels of the core data model. Both contributor types are linked to a standardised public profile that describes contributors in a structured format loosely based on the Datacite metadata collection standards. This public profile can then be linked to any number of projects, datasets, samples or measurements via an intermediary table that stores the role(s) of the contributor with regards to the associated database entry.

The specific roles available vary depending on what level of the core data model the contributor is being linked to. At the dataset level, roles are based predominantly on the Datacite metadata collection standards in order to facilitate formal publication of datasets through external services. 

The contribution framework is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for the addition of new contributor roles and types as needed. Ultimately, the purpose is to accurately track the contributions of individual contributors across the entire portal and beyond. This ensures that contributors are properly credited for their efforts, and that the integrity of the scientific record is maintained. 


# Credit Attribution

Proper credit attribution when creating, distributing and publishing scientific data is essential for the integrity of the scientific record.



## Contributor Roles

FairDM adopts a roles-based approach to credit attribution that adheres to, and extends the Datacite schema. 


Roles also serve a second purpose, defining the level of access a contributor has to the data. This is particularly important for large, multi-disciplinary projects where different contributors may have different levels of access to the data.
