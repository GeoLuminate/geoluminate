<!-- e.g. with ORCID, ROR, Datacite -->
## ORCID

ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a persistent digital identifier that helps in accurately and reliably attributing work to its creators, thereby reducing confusion over authorship and ensuring proper recognition for contributions to research. ORCIDs are increasingly being adopted by publishers, funders, universities, and other research-related organizations as a standard way of identifying and linking researchers to their work.

Geoluminate integrates with ORCID in order to facilitate proper accreditation of researchers and contributors. By leveraging ORCID, Geoluminate ensures that the necessary information for attribution is captured accurately, making it easier for researchers to publish their datasets while ensuring that their contributions will be appropriately acknowledged within the scholarly community.

Geoluminate makes it easy to associate an authenticated ORCID iD with a user account via 3rd party authentication during sign up.

## ROR (Research Organization Registry)

ROR is a community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for every research organization in the world. ROR IDs are machine-readable, and they provide a way to link research organizations and their affiliations with research outputs, funding, and other scholarly activities.
